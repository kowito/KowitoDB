# KowitoDB Roadmap

Research-grounded direction for KowitoDB. The thesis: **the moat is the
integrated substrate** — vector + native BM25 + reranker + knowledge graph +
agent memory + query planner + SQL in one engine. The highest-leverage work is
whatever exploits ≥2 of those pieces that a pure vector DB doesn't have.

Sources for the research items are in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md)'s sibling
research notes; each item below tags maturity and the key paper/system.

**Legend:** ✅ shipped · 🔜 in progress · 📋 planned · 🔬 potential / exploratory · ⛔ deliberately not pursuing

**Status (v0.29):** every roadmap item is **resolved** — shipped (✅) or a
deliberate, documented non-goal (⛔). The remaining ⛔ items (Raft consensus,
DiskANN on-disk graph, full distributed-SQL planner, GPU indexes) are each a
dedicated multi-week subsystem; they are deferred with rationale rather than
faked. Everything buildable to a *tested, honest* state in this product's scope
is done — including full GraphRAG community summarization (v0.28) and
ColBERT-style late-interaction MaxSim (v0.29), both previously deferred and now
shipped.

## Game-changers (research-grounded, prioritized)

### 1. Contextual Retrieval — ✅ shipped (v0.9.0)
Embed and BM25-index a context-augmented text (deterministic preamble from
metadata + keywords) while storage returns the original content.
- **Evidence (VERIFIED 3-0):** Contextual Embeddings + Contextual BM25 cut top-20
  retrieval failure rate **49%**; with reranking **67%**. — Anthropic, 2024.
- ✅ **Follow-up shipped (v0.25):** **LLM-generated context** (the faithful
  Anthropic version) — with an `LlmClient` configured and
  `KOWITODB_LLM_CONTEXTUAL=1`, each object's indexed text is prefixed by an
  LLM-written situating sentence (stored content untouched); falls back to the
  deterministic preamble otherwise. Mock-tested.

### 2. Reranking — RRF fusion ✅ done · cross-encoder ✅ shipped (v0.19.0)
- ✅ **Already present:** the reranker does Reciprocal Rank Fusion across
  vector/BM25/graph/metadata/time with per-source weights, multi-source boosting,
  and normalization (`Reranker::rerank`).
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.19):** a learned **cross-encoder reranker** (the step that takes
  Anthropic's 49% → 67%). A `CrossEncoder` trait (`rerank.rs`) is always compiled
  so the engine can hold an optional second-stage reranker; the on-device Candle
  `bge-reranker-base` impl (`BertForSequenceClassification`: BERT encoder + a
  single-logit `[CLS]` head) is behind the `cross-encoder-rerank` feature,
  mirroring local-embeddings. Enabled via `KOWITODB_RERANKER_PROVIDER=local`;
  `ask()` re-scores and re-sorts the loaded top-k through it after RRF fusion.
  Trait + wiring are unit-tested with a mock; the Candle path is compile-verified
  (runtime needs the HF model). `KOWITODB_RERANKER_MODEL` overrides the model.

### CRAG-style corrective gate — ✅ shipped (v0.10.0)
When retrieval confidence is low (few results / little cross-source agreement),
broaden the search across vector + keyword and re-rank. The *mechanism* (a
lightweight retrieval-quality evaluator) was the verified part of CRAG.
`KOWITODB_CORRECTIVE_RETRIEVAL=0` disables.

### 3. Mem0-style memory → searchable knowledge — ✅ shipped (v0.25.0)
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.15):** `remember_turn` promotes each conversation turn into a
  searchable knowledge object (stable id → idempotent; `system` turns excluded),
  so past conversation is retrievable via `ai.ask()` and lives in the same store
  as ingested knowledge. The `RecordTurn` RPC routes through it.
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.16):** **memory↔entity graph edges** — a promoted memory is
  linked (`mentions`) to the existing knowledge it references (top full-text
  matches), so memories and facts are mutually traversable in the graph.
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.25):** **LLM-driven distillation** — with an `LlmClient`
  configured, a recorded turn is distilled to the single salient durable fact
  before promotion (or dropped on `NOOP`), so memory holds clean facts rather
  than raw chatter; the stable-id idempotency keys off the distilled fact. Mock-
  tested. (Full ADD/UPDATE/DELETE reconciliation against prior memories is a
  natural extension of the same `distill_memory` seam.)
- **Why us:** we already persist agent memory **and** have a graph index — the
  most *differentiating* item; it makes "agent-memory OS" real.

### 4. Query routing in the planner — ✅ enhanced (v0.20.0) · ✅ NL→SQL (v0.25.0)
- ✅ **Already present:** a rule-engine planner maps detected intent → retrieval
  actions (vector / keyword / graph / metadata / time), so routing exists.
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.20):** **intent-conditioned fusion weights** — the reranker's
  per-source RRF weights are now scaled by the detected intent
  (`Reranker::rerank_for_intent`), so e.g. temporal queries lean on the time
  index, entity queries on the graph + exact full-text, code queries on exact
  full-text, and analytical/listing queries on broad metadata recall. Added an
  `Analytical` intent ("how many / average / count of …") routed to wide
  structured recall rather than tight top-k semantic. Unit-tested (intent shifts
  ranking; `General` matches the base weights).
- ✅ **NL→SQL shipped (v0.25):** with an `LlmClient` configured,
  `answer_with_sql()` translates an analytical question into a single SQL query
  over the `knowledge` table and executes it through the existing DataFusion
  path — real aggregates, not approximations. Mock-tested end-to-end (mock SQL →
  rows over the store); returns `None` (retrieval fallback) when no client.
- **Evidence:** 2025 evals show routing/integration beats RAG-or-GraphRAG alone
  (~+6%). — arxiv 2502.11371.

### 5. RaBitQ quantization (+ DiskANN) — ✅ shipped (v0.21.0) · ⛔ DiskANN deferred
- ✅ **Shipped (v0.21):** RaBitQ-style **1-bit binary quantization** (~32× smaller
  vectors vs f32, ~8× vs int8). Each vector is rotated by a structured random
  rotation (random ±1 sign flip + normalized fast Walsh–Hadamard transform —
  orthonormal, O(d log d), decorrelates coordinates so sign quantization is a
  well-behaved estimator), stored as one sign bit/dim plus two scalars, and the
  graph is navigated in the rotated basis. Distances use the **unbiased RaBitQ
  estimator** (`‖o‖² + ‖q‖² − 2·factor·⟨sign,q̃⟩/√D`). Enabled with
  `KOWITODB_VECTOR_BINARY_QUANTIZE=1` (or `HnswParams::binary_quantize`); the
  rotation persists in the index snapshot. Recall@10 validated vs brute force in
  a unit test; exact matches stay near top-1.
- ✅ **Popcount fast path (v0.23):** binary navigation now scores via a
  **Hamming/popcount** distance over the packed sign codes (no float ops),
  refined to the asymmetric estimator for the final top-k — a measured **~3.4×
  query speedup** on top of the memory win (see BENCHMARKS). Generalized the
  graph traversal to a `Scorer` (full / coarse-prefix / Hamming).
- ✅ **Oversample → rescore (v0.24):** `binary_rerank` /
  `KOWITODB_VECTOR_BINARY_RERANK=1` retains an int8 copy of each vector and
  re-scores the oversampled top-k with it — the production pattern that recovers
  recall the 1-bit codes lose. Measured: **~43% → ~79% recall@10 at the same
  ~3.7× speedup**, trading the 32× memory win down to int8's ~4× (navigation
  still uses the popcount fast path; only the final top-k touches int8).
- **Honest scope:** binary is now a memory **and** speed win, with a recall knob
  spanning 1/32× memory (low recall) → int8 memory (high recall). ⛔ **Deferred:**
  **DiskANN**-style on-disk graph for billion-scale on SSD — a dedicated
  multi-week subsystem (see "Potential / exploratory"), not faked.
- **Maturity:** RaBitQ SIGMOD 2024; production in VectorChord/DiskANN.

## Potential / exploratory (🔬)

- ✅ **Late interaction (ColBERTv2-style MaxSim) — shipped (v0.29):** a
  `MultiVectorIndex` stores a *set* of token vectors per object and scores by
  **MaxSim** (`Σ_q max_d q·d`), preserving term-level matching a single pooled
  vector averages away — the highest quality ceiling among dense retrievers.
  Supports brute-force scoring or candidate-restricted rerank (the production
  ANN→MaxSim two-stage). Engine methods `index_token_vectors` /
  `late_interaction_search`, persisted in a snapshot, cleaned up on delete.
  Unit-tested (token-level matching, candidate restriction, save/load). The
  token vectors come from a multi-vector model (e.g. ColBERT) — KowitoDB indexes
  and scores them; it does not bundle the model (same boundary as the
  cross-encoder). PLAID-style centroid pruning for scale remains future work.
  — arxiv 2112.01488, 2205.09707.
- ✅ **Matryoshka embeddings (MRL) — shipped (v0.22.0):** adaptive-dimension
  retrieval. With `HnswParams::coarse_dim = Some(d)` (or
  `KOWITODB_VECTOR_COARSE_DIM=d`) the HNSW graph is navigated using only the
  first `d` dimensions (a cheap coarse pass), then the final top-k is refined at
  full dimension so the returned ranking stays exact. Requires MRL-trained
  embeddings whose prefixes are valid (OpenAI `text-embedding-3`); ignored under
  binary quantization (the rotation precludes prefixes). Recall@10 ≥ 0.7 vs brute
  force validated in a unit test. Pairs with the quantization + reranker layers.
- ✅ **LazyGraphRAG-style auto-graph — shipped (v0.26):** a cheap deterministic
  entity extractor at ingest (capitalized proper nouns + keywords) links each
  object to prior objects sharing an entity via bidirectional `co_mentions`
  graph edges, so the graph is useful even without explicit relationships — the
  LazyGraphRAG insight (a light extractor enriches the graph at ~0.1% of full
  GraphRAG cost) without any LLM. Default on (`KOWITODB_AUTO_GRAPH=0` disables),
  fan-out bounded. Unit-tested.
- ✅ **Microsoft GraphRAG — full community summarization shipped (v0.28):**
  `GraphIndex::detect_communities()` finds communities via deterministic label
  propagation over the (auto-built) graph; `build_community_summaries()`
  LLM-summarizes each; `global_query()` answers holistic "what are the themes?"
  questions by **map-reduce over community summaries** (partial answer per
  community → combined answer). Mock-tested end-to-end; degrades to a
  deterministic digest / retrieval fallback without an LLM. **Opt-in / on
  demand** by design — full summarization is token-expensive (~79M tokens in one
  benchmarked config), so it is built explicitly after ingest, not per write.
- ⛔ **Out-of-core / billion-scale (DiskANN on-disk graph):** the genuine path
  beyond RAM, but a production on-disk ANN graph (memory-mapped adjacency, SSD
  I/O scheduling, beam-search tuned for page faults) is a dedicated multi-week
  subsystem that can't be built to a *tested, honest* state in-session. The
  binary-quantization spectrum (1/32× memory) already pushes the in-RAM ceiling
  far out; DiskANN is the explicit next-major-effort, *deliberately deferred*.
- ✅ **Multimodal embeddings — supported:** knowledge objects are
  content/embedding-agnostic (the store keeps content as bytes and embeddings as
  named vectors), so image/audio/text vectors from any model coexist in one store
  and are retrieved by the same HNSW path. No model is bundled — point the
  embedding client at a multimodal endpoint. (No engine change was needed; this
  is a capability statement, not new code.)

## Scale / infra

- ✅ **Distributed mode (v0.11)** — a `gateway` coordinator fronts N data nodes:
  writes are partitioned by id (consistent `id % N`) and optionally replicated;
  reads scatter-gather across nodes and merge (search/ask de-dup + re-rank;
  stats/list aggregate). Speaks the same gRPC API, so SDKs are unchanged.
- ✅ **Toward HA (v0.12–0.14):** tunable **write quorum** (`--write-quorum`),
  **failure-aware reads** (tolerate partial failure, error only on total outage),
  a **heartbeat health layer** (v0.13 — probe nodes every ~5s, skip unhealthy on
  reads, auto-recover), and **read-repair** (v0.14 — `get` heals replicas missing
  an object, converging after a W-of-R quorum write).
- ✅ **Last-write-wins reconciliation (v0.26):** `get` now returns the *freshest*
  copy (latest `updated_at`) across replicas and repairs any replica that is
  missing, staler, or content-divergent — so divergent copies converge on read,
  not just missing ones. Unit-tested with seeded divergent replicas.
- ✅ **Distributed-SQL aggregate pushdown (v0.27):** a top-level scalar aggregate
  (COUNT/SUM/MIN/MAX, no GROUP BY) is now *combined* across shards into one
  global row instead of returning per-shard partials; other queries concatenate.
  (AVG/GROUP BY need per-shard sub-aggregates and remain concatenated — a full
  distributed-SQL planner is out of scope, see below.) Unit-tested.
- ✅ **Rebalancing on membership change (v0.27):** `Cluster::rebalance()` relocates
  objects whose ownership shifted after nodes were added/removed — copying each
  to its correct owner replica set and dropping it from nodes that no longer own
  it. Best-effort, idempotent, health-aware; unit-tested.
- ⛔ **Parallel HNSW build via fine-grained locking** — *superseded.* Sharded
  per-shard parallel build already removes the global write-lock bottleneck
  (~20× build speedup, see BENCHMARKS); fine-grained intra-shard locking isn't
  worth the complexity on top of it.

## Honest limits of distributed mode

Real horizontal distribution with tunable durability (write quorum), health
tracking, read-repair + last-write-wins reconciliation, scalar-aggregate
pushdown, and rebalancing on membership change. It is still **eventually
consistent, not linearizable**: there is no consensus, so concurrent conflicting
writes resolve by last-write-wins (not serializability), and the gateway is a
single coordinator. The deliberate non-goal below (Raft) is what a
strongly-consistent cluster would require.

## Deliberately not pursuing (⛔)

- **Raft / consensus for linearizable reads:** KowitoDB is single-node-first with
  an eventually-consistent gateway by design; the LWW-reconciled, quorum-write
  model fits a knowledge/agent-memory store. A full Raft log + leader election +
  membership protocol is a separate product (and easy to get subtly wrong) — we
  won't ship a fake one.
- **Full distributed-SQL planner (cross-shard joins, GROUP BY):** scalar
  aggregates are pushed down and merged (v0.27); general distributed query
  planning (shuffle joins, partial GROUP BY → re-aggregate) is a query-engine
  project of its own, beyond the integrated-retrieval thesis.
- **DiskANN on-disk graph:** real and valuable, but a dedicated multi-week
  on-disk ANN subsystem (memory-mapped graph + SSD I/O scheduling) — deferred as
  an explicit next-major-effort rather than faked (see "Potential / exploratory").
  (Late interaction / ColBERT MaxSim, formerly here, is now shipped — v0.29.)
- **GPU indexes (CAGRA):** off-thesis for a single-node, on-device-friendly engine.
